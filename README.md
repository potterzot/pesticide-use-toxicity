#Pesticide Use and Toxicity

It is fairly clear from Benbrook (2012) that overall pesticide use has increased in the past twenty years, but several others have documented declines in pesticide use for some pesticides, particularly insecticides used on *Bt* Cotton and Corn [*citations needed*].

In this effort, we seek to evaluate pesticide use in the context of pesticide toxicity to humans. Has pesticide use shifted for the better, in that while we perhaps use more pounds of pesticide per acre, the overall toxicity of the pesticides used is lower?
